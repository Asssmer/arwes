The Arwes animation management is composed by a set of tools which follow the
[project guidelines](../guidelines/guidelines.md) and is implemented in
[React](https://reactjs.org). It goes hand in hand with the
[sounds management](../sounds-management/sounds-management.md) though it is not
a dependency.

## Animation Tools

Recommended tools to make component HTML elements animations with the animation
flow are [animejs](https://animejs.com) and [GreenSock](https://greensock.com).
